# Term-Deposit-Potential-Customer-Prediction
Term deposits stand as a significant revenue stream for banks, representing cash investments held within financial institutions. These deposits yield returns at agreed-upon interest rates over specified terms. To promote term deposits, explained by dataset banks employ diverse outreach strategies like email marketing, advertisements, telephonic outreach, and digital marketing.

Among these strategies, telephone marketing campaigns remain a powerful way to attract customers. However, implementing this kind of campaign requires a large investment in a large call center. **Conditions based on the dataset also explain that the marketing strategy, although categorized as the most effective compared to other strategies, is described as having a low conversion rate of only 11.7%.**

**The hypothesis that the team can give based on this condition is that the bank institution does not yet have an idea of potential customers for marketing campaigns.** Therefore, a solution is needed in the form of potential customers understanding

This project applies a supervised machine learning approach as a solution for understanding potential customers. **The aim of this project is to be able to build a model that has an accuracy and precision of more than 85% as a better representation of the conversion rate than the current situation.**
